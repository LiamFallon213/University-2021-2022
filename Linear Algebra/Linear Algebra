## Vector spaces

Definition: A **vector space** is a set of objects (referred to as abstract vectors) that can be *added* to each other and *multiplied by scalers* so that the following rules hold
1. x+y=y+x
2. x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z
3. α(x+y)=αx+αy

Ex of Vector Space: n-duim cartesian space ℝ<sup>n</sup> of (column) vect x<sup>-></sup> [x1,x2,x3...]<sup>T</sup>
2. P<sub>n</sub> the *set* of all polynomials of degree ≤ n.
Consisely, P<sub>2</sub>={ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c : a,b,c ∈ ℝ}.

3. The set of all real functions; f:ℝ → ℝ

M<sub>N</sub> = the set of all M x N matricies.

On the test, is something a subspace.

Definition: A subspace is an (ambient) vector space is a set *S*, contained in the vector space, that is "closed under t and." that is two conditions are satisfied.
1. if v,w are in *S* then v+w is in *S*
2. if v is in *S* and c is a scaler then cv ∈ *S*
L= {α v<sup>-></sup> : α ∈ ℝ}
