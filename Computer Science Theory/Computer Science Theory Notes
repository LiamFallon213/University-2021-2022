### Finite state machine


#### Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
> **Deterministic**: The same input always results in the same events or outcome.

An example of a DFA is a Cellular Automata.

##### Characteristics of a DFA
* A single start states
* Multiple accept states
* Reject states (not accept states)
* DFA's either accept or reject strings

##### DFA String Processing
<br>

1. Start at start state

2. Select first character in string
3. Update state by following transition that corresponds to character
4. Select next character in string
5. Repeat 3 & 4 until end of string.
6. If final state is accept state, accept, otherwise reject

##### DFA rules
1. Finite set of states, **Q**
2. Finite alphabet, **∑**
  * Consists of transition characters (i.e. the characters in the strings that the DFA processes)
3. Transition function, **𝛿: Q X ∑ -> Q**
 * **𝛿: Q X ∑ -> Q** means that every state needs to handle every element of the alphabet, (every possible input), exactly one time. No contradictions.
4. Start State **q<sub>0</sub> ∈ Q**
5. Set of accept states, **F ⊆ Q**

##### Definitions
> The set of all strings a DFA, *M*, accepts is called its **Language**, *L(M)=A*
M **recognizes** A

>A language is **regular** if some DFA recognizes it.
*How do you prove a language is regular:* build a DFA for it

### Regular Exceptions

- X* means any number of X's including 0.

 - (xy)* = any number of copies of xy


- X<sup>+</sup> = one or more X's

 - (XY)<sup>+</sup> = one or more (XY)'s

 - Concatanation works like implicit multiplicatior or iuses hollow dot like dot product.

 - U = or

 - ∩ = And

 ## Project 1

 ### Build State machine of gumball machine

States:
- Has Quarter
- No Quarter

Actions (transitions):
- insertQuarter
- removeQuarter
- turnCrank

## DFA/NFA Limitations

If all regular languages have property ***P***, and some new language ***L*** does not have ***P***, then ***L*** is not a regular language.

- All **finite** languages are regular

  - You can build a DFA for each individual string in the languages  


- All **non regular** languages are **infinite**

- Finite Automata's (FA's) can not process **infinite** strings
- **Arbitrarily** long strings are acceptable

Languages where all strings have bounded size (each string has size <= n for some size n) are regular

## Non regular languages

### Must

- be infinite

- have arbitrarily long strings



## Regular Language Properties
Given a regular language *L*, ∃ a number *p* such that **any** string s ϵ *L* with | s |  ≥ *p*, can be divided into three pieces, *s=xyz* satisfying:
- x y <sup>i</sup> z ϵ L, ∀ i ≥ 0
- | y | > 0
- | xy | ≤ p

To prove language is not regular, you must prove there is no xyz that can fulfill the pumping lemma.
